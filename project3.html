  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Kaupo Kupahu and I'm a student at WCC. This website is my project for ICS 107.</p>
<p>I'm interested in web development and learning HTML. This site will grow throughout the semester.</p>
<p> I wanted to create a website that helps people understand what it means to be a gamer. This way, everyone is able to learn about gaming culture and its impact on society.</p>
