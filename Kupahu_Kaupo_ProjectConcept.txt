=== PART 1: PROJECT OVERVIEW ===
1. Project Title:
   Gamers Unite
2. Project Theme:
    Educational/Tutorial Site
3. Personal Connection:
    In 7th grade, I was given a nintendo switch for Christmas I think. My first few games were Super Smash Bros Ultimate, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, etc. Some of the games I play are platform, sandbox, racing, as well as mobile games like Clash Royale. I am passionate about video games and want to help people make connections with others, develop core motor skills, and just find games that they can be passionate about.

=== PART 2: AUDIENCE AND PURPOSE ===

4. Target Audience:
    My target audience is hawaii residents ages 17-24 who are interested in video games who have basic internet skills and have access to smartphones and video game consoles alike. They're looking for reliable and effective ways to find video games that they love that can also teach them valuable life skills. Many first time gamers don't know what games to start palying and need guidance on what to play.

5. Site Purpose
    The site helps people discover and productively enjoy video games while also learning motor and cognitive skills through video games. It solves the problem of learning different video game terms, complexity of games, or mental effort vs relaxation by providing simple details on video game genres, motivation to begin playing, and tips on what games to choose in one place. They should feel confident in their ability to choose games that suit their personality if they are new or play style if they are more experienced. I want visitors to bookmark the page and return to when they want to find new games to play or learn more about video games in general.
